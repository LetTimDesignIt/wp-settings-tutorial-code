# WP Settings Tutorial Sourcecode

### Project Introduction

This repository contains the source code for the *WordPress Settings* series featured on my blog at [timscheman.com](https://timscheman.com/blog/category/wordpress-settings/). Each article in the series will include a link to the corresponding source code found here, making it easy to follow along and implement the concepts discussed.

### Installation and Usage

1. **Clone or Download:**  
   You can either clone the repository or download the ZIP file to get started.
2. **Namespace Customization:**  
   All functions in the code are currently namespaced with `ltdi`. Be sure to change this namespace to something unique that fits your project to avoid potential conflicts.
3. **Translation Domain:**  
   The translation functions are set with the domain `'ltdi'`. Make sure to update this to a custom domain specific to your project to ensure proper localization.
